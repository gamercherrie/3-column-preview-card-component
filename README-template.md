## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
  I recently just learned how to use CSS border-box model and the box-sizing. I found it really helpful especially with sizing
  the elements. I have also started implementing a good practice, which is to make an index css file that has root variables and
  root design. I also found it easier doing so because then I do not need to remember the hex or number I used for the colors.



### Useful resources
